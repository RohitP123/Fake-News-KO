""Coming in tonight we saw it going a lot differently. We probably didn't create enough and they were pretty cut-throat going forward themselves. Overall a very frustrating night at Hampden but we've got to pick ourselves up for the friendlies in the summer.

""We're not naive enough to know we're going to have it all our way. There's been plenty bumps in the road and this is probably going to be one of them. It's about now how we react from this and bounce back hopefully get ourselves in a really good place going into the qualifiers.

Kenny McLean: ""Difficult to take. We put so much into the first leg and knew they were a good team.

""The goals are so disappointing on our behalf and we didn't create enough either. To work so hard to get into the position we were in and kind of throw it away there is really disappointing.

""We need to get better. We're going to play Greece in the near future so we know we cannot underestimate them in the slightest.""

John McGinn: ""We started pretty well, had a couple of chances, we just let ourselves down with the first goal we conceded. We've got to reflect now before two friendlies in the summer.

""It's an embarrassing night for us, everyone is flat in the stadium, we let ourselves down.

""No threat in behind, probably too easy to pick up. Greece deserved to win.

On Friday the airport lost its electricity because of a fire at a nearby electric substation, which provides power for the area, forcing it to close.

With thirteen hundred flights affected, many people in the UK and around the world had trips cancelled or delayed, including children on school trips or visiting family abroad.

What do we know about him?,"From the outset, contender Ash Regan said Mr Murrell's position as SNP chief executive was a ""clear conflict of interest"".

And this theme would not go away with another candidate, Kate Forbes, questioning the integrity of the electoral process.

What led the chief executive to go was linked to a row about party membership and who would be voting in this election.

One point of pride for Mr Murrell had been his campaign to increase followers after the failed Scottish independence referendum of 2014 and the coronation of his wife as leader and first minister.

The SNP went from a membership of less than 25,000 in 2013 to more than 125,000 by December 2019.

But that figure had fallen back to 72,000 by March 2023 and the party only reluctantly confirmed this when media and opposition pressure, plus questions from all three candidates, became too much.

The power couple who helped shaped Scottish politics in the first two decades of this century were no more. In January, the couple announced that they were to end their marriage ""with heavy heart"", having been separated ""for some time"". 

The police have since confirmed that Sturgeon and former SNP treasurer Colin Beattie are no longer under investigation.

Justin, Sarah and Anthony get an inside view from Celeste Wallander, one of Biden and Obama’s top security staffers who has been in meetings with Vladimir Putin.

How does the Russian leader behave during negotiations, and what advice does she have for the Trump administration? 

We also look at what Trump’s reset of US/Russia relations means for Europe, and the war in Ukraine.
