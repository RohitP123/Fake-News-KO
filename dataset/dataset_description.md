# Fake News Knowledge Obsolescence Dataset

The dataset `Fake_News_KO.csv` is a combination of multiple datasets that we use for experiments on combating Knowledge Obsolescence in Fake News Detections. The majority of articles come between 2016 and 2018. This dataset, specifically combines two sources:

- **ISOT Fake NewsDataset:** Dataset containing real and fake news from different subject categories.
- **FakeNewsNet Dataset:** Real and Fake News from gossipcop and politifact (fact checking websites)

In order to properly combine these datasets, preprocessing was done to collect dates, drop columns, and format entries appropriately. The specific code to perform these operations can be found in the following python files:

- **`date_scraper_from_url.py`:** Follows news article URLs to obtain dates for articles from FakeNewsNet.
- **`ISOT_FakeNews_preprocessing.py`:** Filters data and removes unecessary columns from the ISOT dataset.
- **`combine_csvs.py`:** Helper file to combine csv's with the Label, Title, Date format to create our overall dataset.
  
## Dataset Structure

The combined dataset contains the following columns:

| Column | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| **label** | Represents if the data is true (1) or false (0). |
| **title** | The title of the news article. |
| **date**  | The publication date of the article in `YYYY-MM-DD` format. |
  
## Dataset Preview
The following shows some example rows of our dataset.
